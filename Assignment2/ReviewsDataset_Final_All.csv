Reviews,R/ F
The staff is very attentive to all needs. From doorman to concierge to front desk. Rita & Annie were very nice. Itâ€™s lovely to go to a hotel that when you show up the next week they welcome you back like a permanent resident! Thanks Team for making me feel like family!,R
"Best hotel in Vancouver for price range. Most modern and well built hotel rooms. State of the art. No expense spared... sort of like his presidential campaign I guess. Service was second to none, probably some of the best I've experience throughout the world of travelling and staying at 5 star hotels. Location is spot on for brief trips to vancouver or business travel. House Car service was valuable for us. Very generous with early check in and late check out too. Would stay again and would also look favorably towards booking within this chain around the world now as a result of our experience / stay.",R
"I cant say enough good things about this establishment. It is by far the best hotel i have stayed at in vancouver, all the amenities are flawless. The staff is flawless and knowledgeable. Very little room for improvement over all.  The only hotels that can compete in this city were always atleast 100 dollars more per night. If the name on the front door turns you away.grow up and Rize that is getting in the way of the best weekend youve ever had in vancouver.",R
Best hotel weâ€™ve ever been to the staff are so nice and welcoming DONT make you feel out of place even though we were probably the youngest people there. The bed was the comfiest bed Iâ€™ve ever slept on.,R
"It is a nice hotel, but nothing special. I do not think it is worth the money, the Mott 32 restaurant breakfast is $42 per person and you can eat better at Mcdonalds. Most of the staff do not speak good English and they are hard to understand.",R
"Excellent customer experience. Hotel staff was friendly and extremely knowledgeable and helpful. From the front desk when checking in to the time of check out the service was impeccable. Prior to check in our vehicle was valet parked, we had high tea in the champagne lounge which was absolutely a treat and staff once again knowledgeable. Our room was much larger to what one we have experienced when travelling and room was spotless, full the most up to date technology and just what we needed to relax for a few nights before departing home, The hotel is central in the city of Vancouver and a our first time to the city we were central and near to  some beautiful restaurants and coffee shops. Thank you to Brent who recommend the hotel. A first class experience. The only downside if",R
Trump Tower delivered on all aspects of my stay. I must admit this was one of my best hotel stays to date. I hope Trump Tower hotels are available for more of my travel needs throughout the rest of 2020.,R
"The impression of the hotel was excellent from beginning.  I drove a rented vehicle to arrive the hotel for check-in.  The valet parking staff was very friendly and helpful.  The staff from housekeeping, in-room dining, Mott 32 and the lounge were doing a perfect job. I will stay there again.",R
Beautiful Hotel in a perfect position in downtown . Very big and well furnished room. Spectacular view. Good in-room service. Very beautiful SPA with a wonderful party pool. Excellent service. Worth the price.,R
"Top to bottom,  they are an excellent study in :""team work"".   From Mr. Frasier that greeted us out front, to the dinning Room staff,  the daily room attendants,  the room service, to the work-out gym attendants,  they all are highly trained, pleasant folks to interact with. They are the epitome of ""Team Work"".",R
We loved this hotel and stayed twice over the last year.  Incredibly clean and inviting!   The staff so polite and welcoming!  The location is perfect and also close to the water!   Absolutely one of our favorite hotels to stay!,R
Very professional staff  Classy and efficients Cocktail and breakfast excellent  Not to mention rooms modern luxury with all raffinements and domotic  you are entitled to have in this kind of hotel Congrats,R
This place is first class! Every detail has been thought about! Super professional & friendly staff! Great valet service for the car! The swimming pool and spa was fantastic! The heated floors in the room were a big plus! The views from the 18th floor were breathtaking! The beds were the best! This is a 5 star place!,R
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel as a treat for her birthday! Overall we loved it. The room was clean and had a lot of nice touches. The shades and blinds are electric. The television was huge. There is a shower cap in the room in one of the little boxes. If you open it, it also has a hair tie which we thought was a nice touch that most companies donâ€™t think of. The amentity bottles are large. We found the bed very comfortable but the pillows were too soft. We couldnâ€™t fold them enough to make them firm. The Only cleanliness issue was the water glasses. It seemed that they had toothpaste residue from a previous guest. The turn down attendant and the in room dining server were both very nice. We had only ordered dessert but the flavours were fantastic and the plating was",R
Great hotel for seeing Vancouver. Super location close to shops and waterfront. Exceptional service from checking in staff. Very helpful and friendly- important in a city hotel. Good advice on how to spend our time in the city.,R
We booked the Trump hotel and enjoyed of our selection. They have perfect stuff. The internet was excellent. Foods were delicious with best quality. Services were excellent. They cleaned the room twice a day. They  charged mini bar everyday. Tank you.,R
"Very modern, quite large room with all buttons operated _Ÿ˜ÅTo open the curtains, to turn on/off the lights and tv, with very beautiful touchscreen panel. Quite interesting experience. Very good location. Beautiful view from our big windows. Just minutes walk to the famous Robson street. Itâ€™s worth to try! Thank you for the wonderful stay experiences with you! All the best!",R
"We went for the night expecting the worst. Just for fun. Everyone was so nice and chill. It is very expensive. But we have been back and will certainly be returning. It is fancy, but not snobby. The pool is awsome. The bath tub in the room is also great.",R
This was an amazing hotel experience. The Trump hotel brand we experienced was incredible and there were no pictures of Donald Trump or retail shops selling MAGA/KAG gear. The service was the best we have ever had and people of all nationalities and ethnicities were enjoying their stay in the most sophisticated building in downtown Vancouver. NO politics just amazing service!!! Any other hotel in Vancouver would be unthinkable.,R
I wish all hotels were run so professional like Trump Hotel Vancouver. The place is spotless! All of the staff was so friendly and willing to help or answer questions. They didnâ€™t avoid guests like some places,R
"Firstly, although we have had several stays in Trump hotels that have been wonderful, this last one seemed lacking in what is expected to be a luxury hotel as noted in the 3 star review. My husband and I have stayed in this particular Trump hotel once before, as well as Trump SoHo previously. We absolutely loved the level of service, amenities, and luxury accommodations. However, we were left disappointed this last stay when we came for one night on our way hone from Whistler. We got there early at 2:00 and were told our room would not be ready until check in which is officially 3:00. This was fine, so we ate at their on site Chinese restaurant (fantastic food!) and came back at 3:00. The suite was still not ready, we were told they would call us when it was (they had double",R
"Trump hotels and resorts always do it best. Our stay in Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver was awesome. The room we stayed in are fabulous, spotlessly clean, spacious, ample of sunlight, well lit and so high tech! Turndown service is rare these days, but not with the Trumps - kids love the surprises. The hotel bars and restaurants are awesome too - good food and drinks. We had the Oyster and Champagne Happy Hour - highly recommended! We love the pool - it was great and it is different - worth checking out. Interactions with the hotel staff were all pleasant, but one staff in particular - Annie, was top notch in her customer service, communication and resolution skills (we're very impressed!). Location of the hotel is good, close to the shopping area with plenty of great",R
A very delightful stay.  The best service and very friendly and patient employees.  They welcomed questions and was eager to help you. Would be delighted to stay again and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay.,R
"Overall, we love the Trump Hotel, in particular, the extra level of personal service by Frasier. He took the time and effort to say hello as well as being sincere in all his conversations with myself and my family.   The downsides to this trip were with the front desk staff. When we checked-in, we had to wait 1.5 hours after 3pm (~4:30pm local time) before our room was ready. When we finally checked in, the front desk said that a late check out would be no problem. So when I called for a late check out, esp. since we had to wait 1.5 hours when we checked in, they said that they could not accommodate the request. It was only after repeated requests and an explanation of our check-in experience that they only gave 1 hour. For this incident, I would say that the staff at the front",R
"My room was smaller than I expected from the Trump brand, after staying at Trump Las Vegas. The layout was strange, and absent of good 'flow'. It was immaculately clean though, and I liked the shower vent and bathroom mirrors.",R
"Toilet light not working, had to call twice to get it fixed. Drapes not closing 100%. Nespresso not working, pod stuck on the machine for idk how long - it's gross! Washroom though was almost spotless!",R
Nothing compares to Trump tower. We canâ€™t stay away! You get what you pay for. Pamper yourself and â€œget it right for romance & decadence!!â€ù Mott 32...second to none! Reservations a must. How can food taste THAT good?,R
"I stayed in room 1808. Room was spacious, magnificent views, and welcoming and friendly staff. Place was clean, bed comfy (although initially quite hard, I asked for a softer mattress and it seems they complied). Gigantic TV, somewhat noisy but acceptable aircondition, and a sophisticated â€œtablet-styleâ€ù system for controlling room lighting, blinds, curtains e.t.c. Large shower.  Only underwhelming part was the gym, which is not that big and has a large selection of cardio machines, but only a few weight machines, no barbells (only dumbbells) and a no smith rack, all things I would expect at a hotel of this size.",R
"This was our first time staying at the Trump  Towers and we were not disappointed.  Staff was amazing very professional and accommodating.  Room was amazing with many extra details.  Fine china for coffee, heated floors and much more.",R
"Our first trip to Vancouver and the staff at the Trump Hotel were extremely friendly and their service was above and beyond. They treat everyone like a VIP and the room we stayed in was clean, modern and first class. The valet guys even drew us a map to visit Whistler, which we did and it was an awesome experience. First Rate Hotel. You will not be disappointed.",R
"We stay at different hotels when we come to Vancouver to visit family. I have been spoiled and wonâ€™t stay at any other hotel Classy, clean modern hotel.  Service was excellent in the Champagne lounge.  Our 2 queen bedroom with wood flooring was spacious with all the high end touches. Electric drapes and shades to the touch screen lights.  The vanity in the tile washroom, has 2 sinks.  Nice size glass shower, and closet toilet for privacy. In room nespresso machine with China tea cups! I canâ€™t wait for my next trip to Vancouver to stay at the Trump hotel.",R
from arrival to checkin to departure all staff were friendly and courteous.  When car was brought on departure they asked if we wanted water and asked to take the old bottle in the cup holder for recycling.  Room had automatic controls for lighting and shades with day and night settings.  A wonderful stay and we will be back.,R
I stayed here overnight on business and enjoyed my stay.  This is a great hotel with nice rooms and excellent service.  The food I ate at the hotel was also excellent.  My only complaint is that the rooms are all fairly low down as the top half of the tower is made up of condos.  This limits the views.  I need a new place to stay with my family now that the 4S is closing.  I will bring them here next time we come to town but need to figure out the best room setup for this.,R
Good service is important. Great service is rare. This staff works under the latter banner and each interaction impressed. The facility is awesome. My room was not huge (not New York small) but was more than adequate and was well appointed. No problem recommending this quality property and team to be your hosts.,R
"This was our first day at a Trump property and it wonâ€™t be the last .  Staff and service here was impeccable . That is exactly what you would expect from a high-end property .  It is an odd entry situation if you come in off Georgia Street you have to walk through the restaurant down to the lobby or otherwise you go around the back and enter in with your car into an alley that takes you to the lobby .  The room was very chic and modern and  minimalistic and  very nicely designed however ours was on the small side.   The bed was very comfortable everything in the room seems to be very well thought out, nice espresso coffee machine .  Very nice shower and bathroom setting with two sinks .  Love the whole digital set up for your curtains lighting etc. nice big screen TV   Highly",R
"Arrived near midnight but staff was in high gear in every way.  Room, food, service top of the line.  Not only that, but my wife liked the pillows so much we inquired about purchasing two of them and Mr. David Lall, Director of Guest Services came to the front desk and had us set up for purchase and home delivery within minutes.  He made sure they weren't shipped too soon so they would get here after we arrived back home. It all made for a great way to start out Alaska Cruise.",R
"The Trump Hotel is fabulous! I had a business trip to Vancouver, and was able to get a room here for a few nights. This place oozes class. The room was the best. The bar was inviting and trendy. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will definitely 100% stay here again in the future.",R
Location is downtown and close to active areas like shopping and Stanley park and the waterfront and the English Bay. The staff is pleasant and the service is great. The room is very clean and tidy. The size of the deluxe room is reasonable. If you are 2 staying in the room I do not recommend the one with the balcony as there is no door for the bathtub and the sinks which gives no privacy. We stayed in a deluxe room and we enjoyed it. The view on the city and the water was also good. The concierge was also very helpful.,R
"Location, spacious and very clean room, and comfortable bed, house keeping staff very polite and caring, everything was great but valet/shuttle services not available for simple requests to help pick up luggage from a neighbouring hotel. That was only disappointing area from my stay in this hotel.",R
Front desk staff very accommodating and pleasant. Room upgrades available. Very clean and pleasant experience. Spa accommodated last minute. Lounge food was great especially the oysters! Bar staff very friendly.,R
"Everything about this property was top notch. Customer service at its finest. I cannot say enough. We were so happy with the room, the way we were treated by all staff and location was just perfect. Rooms were fabulous. They get it right on all levels.",R
"This hotel is great.  The gym is nice, the pool and hot tub is awesome.  The restaurants and bars are fun.  The free shoe shine is nice also.  This was overall a great experience.  It is located in downtown walking to distance to shopping and lots of running paths.",R
"We stayed two nights in this downtown hotel. The room was spacious and modern with luxury touches. The polished bathroom and separate loo was a plus. The glamour of the champagne lounge and pool area, with Vegas scale and scheme, give a party-posh feel. We canâ€™t say 5 stars on cleanliness on account of the floors needing a good scrub.",R
Love the location and modern look and cleanliness of the rooms. Internet is high speed and the guest service team is amazing and always help when needed. Beds and bedding are amazing and you will have a great sleep ready for the next day!,R
"It was our 13 anniversary, and just dreamed to stay in one of Trump hotels. We had great stay, remarcable design, fantastic service. Heuge lobby! Room was very clean. All ameneties are so delicately chosen. Design is very very great! Definately would recomend it to all!",R
surprised my son on his 13th with a quick trip it was perfect. the staff were very accommodating and kind to my new teen. we will definitely be back! We loved the room. it was modern yet very elegant and spacious.,R
Excellent staff!  Food was excellent and the handcrafted cocktails worth the expense !  I recommend the frogs legs.  So moist and crispy !  Parking on Vancouver streets is expensive but still go !   This hotel is exceptionally clean.  Next time I will try the champagne and oysters at happy hour. â€˜,R
"Stayed here the night of the luke combs concert, everything from checking in to checking out was exceptional, definitely not typical guests for a 5 star hotel but we never felt out of place even when we headed out to our country concert in jeans and boots. Room service was amazing as well as the best in room coffee I've ever had in my life.",R
"By far the nicest hotel we stayed in for our 4 day get-away. The room was truly delightful and huge! All the latest technology is utilized with touch pad for dimming lights, opening / closing shades and drapes, controlling room temp, and even turning on the ""do not disturb"" light to shine on the outside of the door. The lounge was great for an afternoon drink and snack. Staff was bar none the most welcoming and helpful of all.  HIGHLY recommend!",R
"I am in the hospitality profession myself, and I was amazed by the wonderful experience I had at the Trump Hotel Vancouver. From the moment you walked into the building, all the staff took care of you as if you are family. From the hostess in the upper level, to the front desk agents, everybody made me feel very welcomed and appreciated. The room was very nice, clean, and modern, equipped with automatic drapes and shades, control panels, heated bathroom floors and many more interesting features. All my requests were fulfilled quickly. Only one thing is the pillows were too soft for me, I am sure they could provide me other ones if I asked, but didn't Rly bother. Good job and thank you to all the staff, you have truly interpreted the word hospitality and made me feel welcomed",R
Loved our stay at the Trump International Hotel. We were here for a short get away weekend. Excellent service and amenities. Very friendly and helpful staff! Felt very safe during COVID as well. Would most definitely stay there again!,F
Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the employees were exceptional. Very friendly and helpful. Great location and the shuttle service was a great bonus. Would definitely stay at this location again if I'm in the area.,F
A beautiful and iconic hotel with a wonderful staff that goes beyond to take care of their guests! We took full advantage of the scenic courtyard and even used the facilities to take anniversary photos! We cannot wait to stay again!,F
"Great service. Cute decor, comfy beds. Nice lounge with a good selection of wine. We also had the chicken caeser salad and it was delicious. Would recommend. Dog friendly with a super close area to walk them (including poop bag stand)",F
"Trump International Hotel was very responsive and flexible in our ever-changing plans. They understood and helped us as we made so many changes along the way. They are conveniently located next to, but not in Vancouver's Old Market.",F
"The room was exceptional. The available food was simple but surprisingly delicious. Staff was most accommodating - smiled, welcomed, offered options, and followed thru. Thank you for a relaxing experience - just what we needed!!!",F
"I recently spent a week in a Queen Suite at Trump International Hotel Vancouver. It was a beautiful room, the staff was friendly and helpful and the stay was very relaxing and comfortable. Valet parking was an awesome feature. We will definitely stay again!",F
"Such a nice hotel! Friendly, clean, and intimate. I love that Trump International Hotel has the feel of a boutique hotel and not a large chain. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The beds were wonderful! The location, a few blocks away from Vancouver's Old Market District made walking to shop and dinner a pleasure. Will stay here again",F
"I stay at the Trump International Hotel 3-6 times a year. It's always easy, quiet, clean, comfortable and friendly. I love the old building and its convenience to downtown amenities. I am always able to find a good rate for my stay",F
"This hotel is beautiful inside and out. The valet parking was friendly and efficient, along with the front desk staff. They have happy hour everyday. We stayed a Saturday and ordered appetizers and drinks. The room decor was amazing and very clean. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Vancouver I would highly recommend it.",F
"We stayed at the Trump International Hotel on the Friday of Valentines weekend. The rooms was perfect, staff was great, and we had a wonderful night. We definitely recommend going down to the hotel lobby bar a drink or two! If you are looking for somewhere to stay when In town for a show at the Orpheum, this is the place to go!",F
"The Trump International Hotel in Vancouver was a dream to stay at! The people who work there provide incredible customer service! They were friendly and seemed like they genuinely wanted to help us. The hotel is stunning, and the rooms are always clean and beautiful. The Trump International Hotel is located downtown, so you're near a lot of fun restaurants, coffee shops, and fun activities. I would highly recommend staying here!",F
I attended my company party at the Trump International Hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were very nice and the atmosphere was charming! I would recommend the Trump International Hotel to anyone looking for a fun and elegant celebration.,F
"Great service, great parking, great food. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The gate to leave the parking lot was broken and someone was outside to let us out immediately. Food was fantastic and drinks were great",F
"Perfect place to break up the drive. Enjoy the old town area, with dinner and love cookies at bed time. Also our to dogs enjoy the visit with you. The staff is always attentive to your needs and wants.",F
"Everything was literal perfection! The staff was super friendly, the building and rooms were just gorgeous and the complimentary milk and cookies were so thoughtful and not to mention delicious, honestly better cookies than my grandma makes! The bed was super comfy and the shower was straight out of my dream home! I will be staying here every time I’m in Vancouver and will look for them in other cities as well!",F
"From the time I stepped through the door I felt welcomed. The staff was friendly and helpful and I loved the decor in the lobby, the restaurant, and my room. Each evening took advantage of the cookies and milk...YUM! Rly appreciated the availability of the hotel shuttle to local attractions and to the airport. Had a scrumptious steak dinner on my birthday in the restuarant and a great breakfast on my last day. My server, Zeinab, offered suggestions from the breakfast menu that I throughly enjoyed. Her positive attitude helped brighten my day.",F
We had a wonderful stay at The Trump International Hotel. The room was beautiful and service was great. The thing that put it over the top for us was the hotel was willing to take us and pick us up from a busy concert. We couldn't find an Uber and they came and got us at nearly 2:00 a.m. It was much appreciated!,F
"Stayed here for a concert. Hotel is walking distance to CHI Health Arena. It is also adjacent to the Old Market, which we love. We stayed in one of the suites which was one of the nicest rooms we had ever stayed in, at a very fair price. This room had been updated I think. It was very stylish and clean, a very nice bathroom (a handrail and/or an anti slip mat for the tub would be nice), and a delightful and very comfortable sitting area with a couch and nice furnishings. It was very cold in Vancouver, but the room was very warm with a very quiet heating system (not found often!). Valet parking was great and worth the expense downtown. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant (The District) was excellent with great staff (I am mentioning Zeinab by name, a delightful, courteous server). I have to say this is one of the nicest moderately priced hotels we’ve ever visited and just about the nicest room. Looking forward to coming back for sure.",F
Enjoyed a lovely stay at the Trump International Hotel...perfect for our anniversary! Wonderful blend of historical building with contemporary amenities. Spotless suite with the most comfortable hotel bed we’ve had in our travels! Staff was so pleasant and responsive...excellent! A relaxing dinner and milk and cookies provided later topped off the evening. Looking forward to our next stay in this classy gem!,F

I have been using Spreaker for at least 5 years. My only complaint is that they need to not give our payments later than the date it's due.,R
World of Books did an oustanding job. The book arrived in fine condition.,R
Terrible quality for a high priced item. Took a long time to get it. No returns because it's a foreign based company. Beware!!,R

Stayed in orlando and it was amazing. Very clean and friendly staff. ,R
We have been Hyatt vacation club owners for nearly 20 years. With the pandemic and lockdowns we’ve not used them for the last 2 years( very understandable). Unlike U.K. companies that have tried look after people after holidays have been cancelled by ensuring refund,R
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - Amman hotel in Jordan and it was a highlight of the holiday. Nice to relax after a hot dusty day at the spa and two pools. Everything was empty due to covid 19  which added to the luxury and feeling of space.  Staff were excellent. ,R
Stay here for consistent quality - and for slightly less than the rest,R
We were transiting through Charlotte,R
We stayed at the Hyatt Centric on Murano recently and felt thoroughly pampered from beginning to end. Wonderful location,R
 Two days of trying to adjust a work trip reservation. multiple phone calls with over then 40 min waits and nothing resolved. I will never use Hyatt for any personal trips in the future. Just insane that you cant change a reservation with online chat. Best advise is to stay somewhere else then have to deal with Hyatts lack luster of customer service ,R
No hotel room is big and the Buffay but I do not like the color of the pool and the smell of it,R

Breakfast at The Verb,R
"Fun, funky and fantastic staff",R
Our two boys (5 and 7) absolutely love this place. Itâ€™s our second visit and just as good as the first. Amalia and Paula took great care of us at breakfast (magical breakfast feast of all the things banned at home with some healthy stuff to placate the parents) and the vinyl selection is so fun. Now weâ€™re off to jump in the pool again - in November - in Massachusettsâ€_,R
"As always, a wonderful, vinyl spinning stay in the Fenway, at The Verb Hotel. Come for the funky atmosphere & vinyl, stay for the wonderful staff & Hojoko restaurant. Crisela will make you feel welcome at Breakfast and Audrey takes care of everything else!",R
"This hotel is beautiful, service is amazing. Ryan is one of the best workers here. We loved him! so friendly and all around cool guy. Also shout out to Chris too. Thank you Verb for the lovely experience, will be back soon xx",R
Staff was warm and exciting the minute we stepped in. The ambiance was as cool as it gets. Itâ€™s like you step into a time warp that somehow includes the 50s through today. Staff and room cleaning was more than accommodating. Super fun location right by Fenway and only a short Uber to and from popular spots. Couldnâ€™t recommend this place enough.,R
"What an amazing, funky place to stay! We loved our experience at the Verb Hotel in Boston. ALL of the staff was super friendly, knowledge and cared about our trip and our experiences while we were in Boston. We loved the vinyl library and having our very own record player in our room! We were in town for a show at the House of Blues, easy walk from the Hotel and plenty of places to grab yummy food nearby. We'll be back for sure!",R
Our stay was absolutely wonderful! We loved this hotel! Everyone was so nice we especially liked Cisco and Mustafa! They were so accommodating and gave good advice which helped since we had never been to Boston. We would definitely stay here again!,R
"very unique hotel and a plus for the kids because thereâ€™s an outside heated pool. It was heated to I think close to 90Â° or maybe 100 which was needed especially if youâ€™re visiting this hotel in the month of February. Not a fan of the breakfast at the diner attached to the hotel but the hotel is located in Fenway so many options for you to choose from. The front desk was very patient, friendly, and helpful. I had such a great time that I booked for another two nights in a month of April with my husband.",R
"The hotel was so fun and had such a great vibe. It was decorated retro music complete with a record player in your room and records in the lobby available for you to listen to in your room. The room was well equipped and had clever touches throughout. In fact, the whole hotel had unexpected, original design from signage to your hotel key to the exterior. The service was even better! Our flight was delayed, and they were very accommodating. Every person we dealt with was friendly, knowledgable, and eager to help with anything we needed. Great location too!",R
"Amalia and her team made our morning so much better! They were all so friendly, helpful and kind, not to mention the breakfast was delicious!! We will be back just for that alone. They took great care of us!",R
"We were in town for appointments at Boston Childrenâ€™s. Iâ€™ve always wanted to try out this hotel. Wish Iâ€™d been picking this one every time! Clean, excellent staff, good quality quick breakfast, relaxing in our room with great records to play on the record player was just unique and funâ€_ especially with my young adult son.",R
"I was taking my high school senior daughter on a college tour to schools in Boston when I accidentally discovered this gem. Iâ€™ve been to many hotels. Iâ€™ve almost never written a review, but what an amazing, novel experience this was! In addition to an incredibly friendly staff, the rock n roll vibe and decor is everywhere. Love the record players in every room AND the hundreds of vinyl albums to choose from in the lobby. And electric guitars we could jam on near the front desk? Wow! One of the coolest, best value places one could find anywhere in the country.",R
The complementary breakfast at the Verb is delicious and the attendants are great! (Thanks Crisela Amador.)I had a waffle and a muffin and they both were wonderful. What a fantastic start to a east coast road trip.,R
crislea was very helpful with serving us breakfast and helping us and offering us anything we needed. I got a choclate crossiant and it was Rly good. i also got a bowl of ceR. It was all very good.,R
Brooked The Verb for a 1 night stay to take my 9yo son to his first game at Fenway. Staff was awesome and the location was perfect. Should have made it a longer stay in Boston but I already had my son miss two days of school for this trip. Absolutely will stay again when I take the rest of the family to Boston. Plenty of food choices near the hotel and in the hotel. My son also learned what a typewriter and record player was thanks to both being in the room. He was amazed at the typewriter.,R
"Great stay! Was there for a medical need and staff was super accommodating. In particular a front desk staff went out to the local CVS to buy me some medicine I didnâ€™t have. And they brought my dinner up to my room from the downstairs ramen restaurant. The breakfast staff, Paula and Kristala were super great too! 10/10 would stay again.",R
This was such a great little eclectic hotel... everyone was so friendly and helpful - the evening manager (sorry I forgot his name) to Saulo and Blanca who were both helpful and kept my room clean. My room had a record player - and you could pick your choice of oldies but goodies and bring them to your room... Will definitely return...,R
"An exciting hotel to tease your visual and audible senses! The decor, the music, and the vibe was more than we expected. And not to forget the complimentary breakfast! Chisela and her staff made every accommodation so that we enjoyed every bite. Highly recommend the Verb, it was perfect from start to finish! The Lindsayâ€™s from VA",R
"My friend and I attended a concert at Fenway and stayed at The Verb Hotel afterwards. The location was great and convenient, the staff was very friendly and nice, the room was clean, and the ambiance was amazing",R
"Not only was the location great, but the hotel itself is awesome. Staff was very friendly and rooms were very clean. They even had a record player in every room-totally worth the price!!! If youâ€™re looking for a hotel to stay at for a Fenway event, look no further!",R
This place was awesome. It is a must stay place for music lovers. The staff was friendly and the hotel was very clean and located within walking distance of many of our needs. We will definitely be back!,R
"This place was better than I expected. Perfect location and within walking distance of restaurants, souvenir stores, and Fenway Park. The zebra robes were a hit with my husband! Super friendly and helpful staff.",R
"The Verb Hotel is such a fun, retro environment! Very friendly staff, including Crisela Amador who served a delicious breakfast, offer a welcoming vibe. Highly recommend a stay at the Verb, especially if you need a quick walk to Fenway Park!",R
Truly the coolest and cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. So neat and different. The staff is INCREDIBLE. Everyone is so kind and Rly helpful. Chris the valet was fantastic and always had our car ready quickly. 10/10 recommend staying here if you get the chance. Best hotel experience in Boston.,R
"hi, iâ€™m korean. i canâ€™t speak english very well. this hotel giving for us very nice night. so If I come to Boston again, I will come to this hotel. Especially the curly-haired male staff, thank you for being so kind to me.",R
"Our stay was awesome! We stayed at the Verb so we could be with in walking distance of Fenway! The room was clean, we had free breakfast, free coffee, and even had a couple discounts for local restaurants when you showed them your room key! Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Verb again!",R
"This hotel is the full rock â€˜nâ€™ roll experience, from the mid century modern meets rock â€˜nâ€™ roll lobby to the clean lines minimalist modern room decor, our stay was top notch. There were some Rly cool little details like free 24 cold brew in the lobby, to the bottle of champagne delivered to my room because it was my birthday, to the zebra rock â€˜nâ€™ roll robes, and the most unique thing was the in-room record player and the huge library of vinyl that you could choose from to bring up to your room The location also cannot be beat, a few minutes walk to the green line train and Fenway Park was right out my window! So very cool!",R
Cool place. Great location. Clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Lots of great music memorabilia. Pool looked nice but we didnâ€™t use it. Valet parking and amenities fee is going to run you an additional $100 bucks per night. Just an FYI.,R
Where do I even begin? This place is like a rock stars dream come true! And if you are dreaming of the Rockstar life then look no further! From playable guitars in the lobby to a heated salt water pool! You feel like you just went backstage after your own show! There are even record players in each room and a FULL ASS SELECTION of LPS to choose from if you feel the need to rock out in your room! Or you can stroll the halls and check out all the memorabilia that they change out to keep it fresh or read the names of all the famous peeps that have stayed here that Aretha Franklin is singing out Witten on the wall near the lobby. I'm writing this out right now sitting out front while there is a band playing in fenway that I can hear is clear as if I'm in the venue. This isn't my,R
"This rock and roll themed hotel is right behind Fenway Park - it took us 2 minutes to walk there. Easy valet parking and in minutes we were sitting on our balcony listening to the tunes of Stevie Wonder as we had a pre-game cocktail. Upon check in, they upgraded us to a deluxe themed room! We stayed in the Led Zeppelin room, which had authentic memorabilia from the band covering the walls. There are record players in each room with a collection of albums in each room, but there is also a large assortment of albums from which to choose from in the lobby. The atmosphere in this place is awesome - trendy, hip and fun. The lobby has nitro cold brew and hot coffee on tap and unlimited water bottles available to guests. We didn't know this upon arrival, but it is a dog friendly hotel!",R
"Every employee, every visitor all were so nice! Check in and out were easy, valet parking was great. Record player and records in the rooms were so fun, and the pool was heavenly. The walk around the building to be at the Red Sox game couldnâ€™t have been easier! Canâ€™t wait to go back!",R
"Great location. Not sure how noise levels would be if there was a baseball game going on as we were literally a stones throw from the back of Fenway park. Consider carefully if you are going to have a car because they charge $65 a night to park your car there. We were fortunate in that we found a garage across the street in the new condo building that was allowing non-condo owners to park there for hourly fees, and ended up spending a total of $55 over 48 hours, even though we came and went multiple times. This was in late August 2021, but that situation may change. If youâ€™re just walking and Ubering around, I definitely recommend this place. It was specialâ€” the music-themed touches were Rly fun. The staff and service were very good.",R
"We stayed at The Verb for a Sox game so we didnâ€™t have a late/long drive home and my only regret is that our stay wasnâ€™t longer. I was worried about having our five year old twins but once we checked in, I Rized it was more family friendly than I anticipated. The rooms were so clean and theyâ€™d even left a Disney vinyl on the record player in our room; no detail spared. We took a quick dip in the pool to cool off before the game and it was great. No complaints!",R
"My first time at the Verb! Not only is the vibe fun with a R record player in your room, the staff was over the top nice and accommodating. Iâ€™ll be staying here when I return to Boston! Also donâ€™t miss out on the coffee in the lobby. So good.",R
"We loved our stay for many reasons. First, close to Fenway for a Sox game, best and most festive breakfast around with amazing live music, great employees from the front desk/Producers to the breakfast crew! We would stay there again in a heart beat!",R
"Groovy, clean (there is always someone cleaning somewhere - and it smells wonderful), cool as s%#+, fun, friendly staff. Definitely choose from the 1500 vinyl options for your in-room turntable. We were there for 3 consecutive nights of games at Fenway - itâ€™s busy, but great to be in the middle of it! Expensive overnight parking - choose the garage around the corner.",R
Fun boutique hotel with outdoor pool and view of Fenway. Staff could not be friendlier. Breakfast buffet was excellent with lots of variety. Smaller rooms but well designed. Love a hotel who thinks of an extra blanket. Also best robes ever in a zebra print with Verb logo. Complimentary coffee and water. If you love Rock and have a great sense of humor this hotel is for you. Pet friendly as well.,R
"Our one night stay for a Red Sox game turned into a mini vacation. The Sox lost but we won, with a great stay. All the staff were fantastic and the complimentary breakfast was way beyond average. I highly recommend this place and will be back for future games",R
"This used to be the old Howard Johnsons. IT is such a fun hotel. Unique atmosphere/retro and colorful decor, very friendly staff, had fun playing assorted records on the turntable. Unlimited water bottles and cold nitro brew coffee on tap 24/7. The room is very clean, bed is very comfy (thank you BLANCA!). Hojoko, the next door Japanese restaurants, is excellent for its food and jelly sake. There are also lots of restaurants around within walking distance. The parking is a bit steep at $65/day, but it beats running to meters all day or trying to find a parking spot without being stressed out. Also, it is right next to Fenway Stadium. The valet people are incredibly nice and will run out to get your car in no time. The continental breakfast is excellent with plenty of delicious",R
"We had such a great time at The Verb! If you are sick of every hotel looking and feeling the same, itâ€™s time to try a boutique hotel, and if you are in Boston you have to stay at The Verb. Itâ€™s right next to Fenway Park, so it would be a great way to stay over if youâ€™re at a game that runs late. The Rock â€˜n Roll theme is fantastic, and the friendly staff carry it off well. Joey, who checked us in was super friendly and welcoming, and Cisco, the valet, was Rly cool. We drove up into the wrong driveway, but he took care of us anyway. He also showed us around the vintage Flxible bus in the Verb parking lot --amazing! Cisco is a nice guy, and he has a great playlist.* We enjoyed the pool, but most of all the general vibe, even just getting the hotel key (er, I mean",R
"I stayed with my family for 3 nights and was very impressed with Saulo and his team, what a great job they did! The room was very clean and the housekeepers was very pleasant. My daughter loved the turn table in the room. Plaining on returning soon.",R
We came for my sonâ€™s 11th birthday to go to a game at Fenway. It was a perfect weekend! Chris Sale pitched for the first time since his surgery and we loved the hotel! So much fun. The kids loved the pool and the records! Mom loved the Nitro on tap 24/7. The breakfast was great and the rooms were clean. I plan to come back and stay for Boston Calling in 2022.,R
