"Crisela and Amalia were so very nice and very sweet. They had everything prepared and we're happy to take special requests, we are very pleased! The smoothies were excellent and they were happy to make them."
This pillow saved my back. I love the look and feel of this pillow. Good padding and nice quality.  I love the feel of the fabric.  I would buy again
"Visiting Boston with our teenage son. We all loved this place. Music/rock vibe is fun, pool lovely on a sunny day, great location next to Fenway, not far from the Charles, and 3 blocks to Fen park with paths, a track, b-ball hoops, and a beautiful rose garden. Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful. Really enjoyed dinner at Hojoko too- great cocktails and interesting food. Was worried slightly about party atmosphere at pool but it was always shut down right at 10 to ensure all guests can have a good sleep."
"Missing information on how to use it, stupid but it is a great product for the price!  I These are so flimsy! They are not the quality you would expect from a piece of furniture."
"We visited Boston for 2 days to go the Green Day/Weezer concert at Fenway. I booked the VERB thinking it looked pretty cool from their website, but honestly the website doesn't do it justice. The theming is on point, the staff is amazing and the restaurant attached is an absolute must! Everything from the fantastic breakfast to the vinyl were above and beyond. Can't say enough about our stay other than that we can't wait to come back. It's very kid friendly as well. Pro tip: get a fenway facing room. We got a free Billy Joel concert from our window the night before Green Day/Weezer!"
Very nice set. Good quality. We have had the set for two months now and have not been horrendous and mad
"Great product, does it's job well holding my lunch several days a week. A little pricey for what it is."
"Great room, very clean, had everything I needed. Friendly, laid back atmosphere. Very relaxing. Nice continental breakfast with friendly servers. Right next to Fenway so it will be loud on game nights -"
My son loves this comforter and it is very well made.  God We also have a baby She also loves it very much
Love this!  Perfect size for an entire family! Very good quality.
"I recently won a contest that The Verb had and was excited to finally stay at this unique boutique hotel. I've been wanting to visit since I first discovered them on Instagram last year. Winning this contest finally gave me the opportunity. From the moment I walked into the lobby I was greeted by friendly, upbeat staff who were genuinely happy to check me in. I've been to hotels where the staff are just going through the motions. Not here. From the front desk to the valet to the girls serving breakfast, it is obvious that the staff at The Verb love their jobs. We had the Deluxe Aerosmith suite and it was decorated with all sorts of cool memorabilia, a record player connected to a small marshall speaker and a balcony view of Fenway Park. We could choose from a large"
Exactly what you would expect. I love the look and feel of this pillow. Fits well and seems to last a long time. Very good quality.
SOOOOOOO cute. I love them. Adorable. Well made and totally worth the price!! Purchased as a Christmas gift.  She will love it.
"We LOVED our stay at the Verb Hotel! It is located just behind Fenway Park, and we chose it specifically for this reason. BUT, it did not disappoint in any other category! We loved the staff--all of them."
Awesome stay awesome theme everything was amazing the pool was awesome the employees were so friendly and hospitable such a cool experience and great selection of music very quiet and comfortable sleep and tasty breakfast
These are so weak and worse. They barely bring in any air. THEY NEED TO BE MORE RESILIENT AND STRONGER.
Wonderful location. The staff are professional and super helpful. Very fun place for families. Nia Jack and Olivia were fantastic and made our stay so fun. They welcomed us when we came in at 1AM with clapping and great big smiles . We felt very welcome and it kicked off a great two night stay.
I WANTED DIFFERENT FLAVORS BUT THEY ARE NOT. Nice but the size of the containers is a little small.Very pretty.
"What a wonderful hotel! We love the personal attention and care. Such a special place and we can not wait to get back to Boston, also telling everyone about it! Thanks again for such a meaningful trip !"
"Fun decor really leans in to the rock-'n'-roll vibe. Found some really cool music to enjoy. The staff was young and responsive. Always a cheerful greeting when we would get back . Location is good, although most restaurants and bars close early."
